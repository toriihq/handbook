# Important channels on Slack

## What not to do

**Do not share any sensitive information that might be leaked in the future**. Our customers data/files should never appear on Slack.

## Channels

Some channels are more interesting than others, here's an overview:

| Channel             | Purpose  |
|---------------------|----------|
| customer-experience | Share feedback and insights from our customers |
| deployments         | See web applications deployments status |
| design              | Discussion around design and branding |
| development updates | Share development questions and updates |
| general             | Everything else |
| github              | Get notified for commits, PRs, comments, approvals, rejections |
| interesting         | Interesting stuff, not necessarily work related |
| lol                 | Things that makes you LOL |
| monitoring          | All alerts of issues/errors end up here |
| product discovery   | Talk about our product's future |
| releases            | Manual feed of released features to production |
