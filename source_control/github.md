# GitHub

## Why GitHub?

[GitHub](https://github.com) is the leading git repository hosting service. Most apps have integrations for GitHub, most open source projects can be found on GitHub and it has tools for collaboration.

## Workflow

The flow is targeted for CI/CD where small changes are merged into the master branch and deployed to production.

To keep the flow **simple** and avoid merge conflicts, we use the following steps:

1. Create a new branch from `master`. Any descriptive name will do.
2. Work on your branch and push changes to GitHub.
3. If there are merge conflicts with `master`, resolve the merge locally. We rarely use `rebase` as we're going to squash the commits on merge.
4. Create a Pull Request to `master`.
5. Once reviewed, `Squash merge` the changes.

Note: `master` should always be deployable, and for most projects â€“ it is automatically deployed.
