# Open Source

## Use Open Source

Use any open source framework, package or tool, but pay attention to its license. It should allow us to use it commercially without disclosing our source code.

To generate a license report for the npm packages, use [OSS License Check](https://github.com/toriihq/oss_license_check) tool we build on top of the `license-checker` npm module.

## Give back

Because Open Source plays a major part in how we build our products, we see it as part of our mission to give back to the community.

This can take two forms:

1. Releasing code that was useful for us. Our public code repos are listed here: [public GitHub repos](https://github.com/toriihq?type=public).
2. Contribute to open source software we use by submitting PRs.
