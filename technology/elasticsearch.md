# OpenSearch (a fork of Elasticsearch)

> OpenSearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data,

## Why OpenSearch?

We chose OpenSearch to allow for faster and smarter APIs.

While MySQL provides proven technology for storing the raw data, it lags behind in the ability to ofer complex filters and searches. 

## OpenSearch on AWS

We chose the managed version of OpenSearch on AWS so we can focus on building the product and not maintaining the OpenSearch cluster.

## Why OpenSearch vs. Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch became non open-source in 2021 and AWS and other companies have forked the project and created OpenSearch. We decided to go with the open-source project fork, which is 100% supported on the AWS platform.
