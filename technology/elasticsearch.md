# Elasticsearch

> Elasticsearch is a distributed, open source search and analytics engine for all types of data,

## Why Elasticsearch?

We chose Elasticsearch to allow for faster and smarter APIs.

While MySQL provides proven technology for storing the raw data, it lags behind in the ability to ofer complex filters and searches. 


## Elasticsearch on AWS

We chose the managed version of Elasticsearch on AWS so we can focus on building the product and not maintaining the Elasticsearch cluster.
