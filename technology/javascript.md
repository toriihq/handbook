# JavaScript

Atwood's Law:
> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?

We chose JavaScript as our single programming language to keep our workflow **simple**.

Using a single language removes the barrier of becoming an effective Full Stack developer, allows developers to take end-to-end ownership of their tasks, and prevents "owned" code by small-group of engineers.

JavaScript is *universal*, the same code can run both on browsers and on servers. It has a great *community* with many answers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and `npm` modules.

## JavaScript version

Using the latest JavaScript features is encouraged. Features such as `async`/`await` simplifies the flow control of our apps so any opportunity to make our codebase simpler is welcomed.

We aim to support only the latest desktop/mobile evergreen browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari.
