# JavaScript

Atwood's Law:
> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?

We chose JavaScript as our single programming language to keep our workflow **simple**.

Using a single language removes the barrier of becoming an effective Full Stack developer, allows developers to take end-to-end ownership of their tasks, and prevents "owned" code by small-group of engineers.

JavaScript is *universal*, the same code can run both on browsers and on servers. It has a great *community* with many answers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and `npm` modules.

## JavaScript version

Using the latest JavaScript features is encouraged. Features such as `async`/`await` simplifies the flow control of our apps so any opportunity to make our codebase simpler is welcomed.

We aim to support only the latest desktop/mobile evergreen browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari.

## TypeScript

In 2022, work started to include TypeScript in our stack. For projects that already support TypeScript, we expect new code to be written in TypeScript.

Code changes for JavaScript files can be done by first replacing the code to TypeScript and then applying the changes. This is not yet mandatory.
